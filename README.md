Implemented advanced clustering techniques using **K-Means** and **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** via **Mclust** to uncover hidden structures in medical data. By optimizing K-Means clustering with **NbClust**, three distinct clusters were identified with high **purity**, effectively distinguishing between **Normal, Prediabetic, and Diabetic** conditions. Model accuracy was validated using **Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests**, ensuring statistically significant insights. Comprehensive visualizations, including **BIC plots** for model evaluation and **contour plots** for dimensionality reduction, further demonstrated **GMM’s superiority over K-Means** in cluster purity, providing deeper insights into medical risk stratification
